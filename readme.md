# Open Kattis Solutions

My repo of solutions for [Open Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)

Some folders contain a solution, others may also include sample tests, descriptions, and in some cases a test generator.

This is meant to be a reference to myself, but others are welcome to look at solutions for help at understanding the problem. Under no circumstances should a solution be "stolen" and submitted as their own. I will warn that some solutions are pretty terrible as they were written in competition format (quickly with little review).

Feel free to contact me if you have questions.
