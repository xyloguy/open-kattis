# Ladder

You are attempting to climb up the roof to fix some leaks, and have to go buy a ladder. The ladder needs to reach to the top of the wall, which is `h` centimeters high, and in order to be steady enough for you to climb it, the ladder can be at an angle of at most `a` degrees from the ground. How long does the ladder have to be?

## Input

The first line of input consists of an integer `N` (1 <= N <= 1000) indicating the number of test cases. the following `N` lines contain two integers `h` and `a`, with meanings as described above. You may assume that (1 <= h <= 10000) and that (1 <= a <= 89).

## Output

Write a single line containing the minimum possible length of the ladder in centimeters, rounded up to the nearest integer.
